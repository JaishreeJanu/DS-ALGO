# Data structures and Algorithms

I love to indulging in problem solving. I am active on competitive programming websites like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/practice/).
In this repo, I add code of successfully solved problems.
The **link to problem statement** of every problem can be found at the top the code file.
