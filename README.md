# Data structures and Algorithms

I love to indulge myself in problem solving in C++ and python3. I am active on competitive programming websites like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [interviewbit](https://www.interviewbit.com/practice/).
In this repo, I add the source code of problems which I have solved and passed all test cases.
In **python directory**, problems solved in python3 have been added and in **C++ directory**, problems solved in C++ language have been added.
The **link to problem statement** of every problem can be found at the top the source code file.
